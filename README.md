# ClassDiagram
Class Diagram Application. Java Code.

This application is an example about how to use javax.swing and java.awt 
in a basic way. The application allows to move the classes with their associations. If you move the mouse over a hide-class, this class is shown. The application also allows to delete classes (when you click right click over it). The application count the number of classes and associations.When the mouse is over a class, you can select the class (pressing 's' key). When a class is selected, the applications allows to create associations, by dragging the mouse (left click pressed).
The application is composed of 5 classes:

Association: It models the behaviour of Associations objects. For example how are they drawn.

Class: It models the behaviour of Class objects. For example how are they drawn.

Diagram: It includes every keyboard or mouse event which is used to interact on the diagram.

Window: It manages the initial interface of the aplication.

Application: It runs the app and manages the Jframe.
